A web application built with **Streamlit** that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn, using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained on structured customer data. The app takes user inputs like geography, age, credit score, and product usage to make real-time predictions and visualize churn risk.

🔍 Powered by:
- TensorFlow/Keras ANN model
- Scikit-learn for preprocessing
